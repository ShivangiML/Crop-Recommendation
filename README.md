Crop Recommendation
This project builds a Machine Learning-based Crop Recommendation System to suggest the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil and environmental conditions. It utilizes a dataset containing soil composition, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pH levels to predict optimal crop choices.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

ðŸ“Š Key Features:

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Model Training using Classification Algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)

Accuracy Evaluation & Performance Comparison
